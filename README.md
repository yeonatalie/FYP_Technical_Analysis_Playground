# FYP_Technical_Analysis_Playground

## Project Objective
This project aims to educate novice retail investors to allow them to make better and more informed trading decisions. More specifically, the project aims to develop an application-based education platform focused on technical analysis.

Finance educators have faced challenges in teaching trading. While students may learn about the financial concepts, they often continue to make irrational trades due to the psychological biases of humans. Technical analysis can potentially help to minimize the impact of these psychological biases.

Hence, this project aims to develop a platform where beginner retail traders can learn about and apply technical analysis as part of their trading strategy.

## Solution Overview: TA Guide
TA Guide is an interactive, technical analysis playground where novice retail traders, who may not necessarily have the relevant financial or quantitative background, can gain an understanding of basic technical indicators, and apply technical analysis as part of their trading strategy.


TA Guide will focus on 2 key sections: generation of trade signals, which includes explanations of how technical indicators can be analyzed, and management of trading strategy such as evaluating strategy returns and the inclusion of risk management measures. The learning content of both sections will be presented in the form of animated visualizations, developed through a charting engine.
